// The scheduler will call callbacks waiting for execution with the same

// for a chosen member of the next lower priority. This member will also be
// chosen in a round robin way.
// Example:
// Assume you have 6 callbacks in the same PriorityTask, all constantly wanting
// to be executed.
// A and B are priority CRITICAL,
// c and d are priority REGULAR,
// x and y are priority LOW.
// Then the execution schedule will look as follows:
// ...ABcABdABxABcABdAByABcABdABxABcABdABy...
// However if only the 3 callbacks, A, c and x want to execute, you will get:
// ...AcAxAcAxAcAxAcAxAcAxAcAxAcAxAcAxAcAx...
// And if only A and y need execution it will be:
// ...AyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAyAy...
// despite their different priority they would get treated equally in this case.
//
// WARNING: Callbacks ALWAYS should return as quickly as possible.  Otherwise
// a low priority callback can block a critical one from being executed.
// Callbacks MUST NOT block execution!
