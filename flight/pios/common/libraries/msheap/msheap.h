/*
 * The heap consists of ranges (free or allocated) separated and
 * bounded by markers.
 *
 * For maximum space efficiency, the default is to use 4-byte
 * 'compact' markers, which limits the heap to a maxium of 128KiB.
 * For larger heaps define HEAP_SUPPORT_LARGE, which doubles markers
 * to 8 bytes each, but allows heaps up to 2^^33 bytes in size.
 *
 * Each marker contains two structures, one describing the previous
 * region and one describing the next.  Thus, markers form a
 * doubly-linked list chaining each region together.
 *
 * Each region is described by two identical structures, providing
 * a measure of referential integrity that can be used to detect
 * overflows out of the region without the use of separate magic
 * numbers.
 *
 * The region descriptor size includes the size of the marker at its
 * head.  This means that zero is not a legal marker value.
 *
 * Free regions are always coalesced, and a pointer is kept to the
 * most recently-created free region to accelerate allocation in the
 * common case where a large number of free objects are allocated
 * early.
 *
 * The heap is bounded by markers pointing to zero-sized allocated
 * ranges, so they can never be merged.
