This is the Milestones file of the OpenPilot project, its intent is to record the major accomplishments
achieved by people using the OpenPilot platform and who gets the karma for performing them.

The Contributors list in the About dialog of the GCS application records the developers and contributors.
This file is different as it is aimed at recording and giving credit to the people who achieve milestones
in the use of OpenPilot.

Notice: now we have the rule: no video - it has never happened. So please make sure you have video
recorded if you want to submit your milestone (listed below or not yet) to this list.

The fields are:
  (M) Milestone description
  (C) Credited to
  (D) Date
  (V) Link to video showing milestone
