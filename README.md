About the SantyPilot Project
============================

### Open - Collaborative - Free

The SantyPilot open source project was founded in December 2023. It's based
on [LibrePilot Project](https://github.com/librepilot/) and it focuses on
research and development of control algorithm to be used in uav/robots,
and in future some of AI applications.

SantyPilot welcomes and encourages exchange and collaboration with other
projects, like adding support for existing hardware or software in
collaboration under the spirit of open source.

SantyPilot finds its roots in the LibrePilot/OpenPilot project and the founding members
are all long-standing contributors in that project.

The SantyPilot Project will be governed by a board of members using consensual
methods to make important decisions and to set the overall direction of the
project.
